- Create a separate readme for terraform, no need to have it in the main one, as it's a one-time job
- Move Terraform related scripts to terraform
- Refactor to not use environmental variables, it's really hard to track, we should stick to
config folder or .env
- Make sure that the only contract between terraform and accelerator are the properties in application.properties
- Environment switching should be done by changing profiles

- Limit the number of bash scripts, if something becomes complex, automate it using CLI
